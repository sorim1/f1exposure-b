  Haas is the worst team of 2021.
<br>
Let us go through the events that lead to this state of affairs, and answer some question about the future of the team. Is the present (lack of) performance "part of the plan"? What even is the plan?

<div class="pt-3 pb-3">
  <h1>The past</h1>
  The history of Haas team in F1 is short, with 2016 as their first season. The team was founded and named after Gene
  Haas, man who already had a strong presence in US motorsport, such as NASCAR, and wished to expand his brand recognition
  worldwide. As he explained it:
  <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
    <div class="left-90">
      <i>"Just like NASCAR is very dominant in the United States - half of our production is actually consumed in the
        United States. If we could increase our market share by even 1 or 2 percent in the rest of the world that would
        almost double our sales. That really is the goal to bring that brand recognition, produce more product in the
        United States and sell more overseas."</i>
      <p>- Gene Haas</p>

  Kannapolis is the location of Haas headquarters. There is a belief that this HQ isn't meaningfully involved in the making of
  the car. This is incorrect, atleast if Haas is to be believed - the design of the car originates in Kannapolis, crucially this is
  where their Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) department is located, led by Ben Agathangelou. In simple terms, CFD uses computer simulations to solve aerodynamics problems. There's a cute saying: "In theory, there is no
  difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is." Well, in theory there is no difference between a CFD
  simulation and a wind tunnel testing.
  So it is Kannapolis that creates the car designs, runs computer simulations, and passes the designs and results on.

  Banbury is the team's European HQ and their raceteam logistics centre, after the facility was bought from the former
  F1 team Marussia. In 2016 when the team was starting, Gunther made short but informative tour through the facility,
  explaining what it is responsible for

    F1 rules split car components into two categories:
    <ul> - 'listed parts' - every constructor has to design themselves (or own the IP to). This includes, crucially, all
  bodywork "in contact with the external airstream," i.e. all aerodynamic surfaces of the car.</ul>
  <ul> - 'non-listed parts' - parts that team can buy from other teams ranging from engines, gearboxes, the suspension system to various mechanical parts.</ul>

  <p>Haas always buys whatever it's allowed to from - Ferrari</p>
  What about the aerodynamic surfaces - the chassis of the car, which cannot be bought? The chassis is made by Dallara, Italian racecar constructor and manufacturer from Varano de' Melegari near Parma, about an hour drive from Maranello. The aerodynamic development and testing of the chassis is done in a wind tunnel. Whose tunnel? You're probably guessing the answer - Ferrari's.

  Haas' very close relationship with Ferrari has been critized by some members of the F1 paddock. On one hand, there are some who
  applaud Steiner's battle to make a small, new team work any way possible (only way possible?) . On the other hand Haas car
  has been accused of looking too similar to Ferrari, implying there was and exchange of information that goes beyond
  what is allowed. These accusations from the rivals were at their height in the year 2018, because the car looked like 2017 Ferrari. Haas defender would point out they at their height because 2018 was the year when Haas was at its height.

    <h1>The present</h1>
    In 2021 season Haas is inarguably the weakest car on the grid. There are multiple reasons, and while a new all-rookie driver lineup doesn't help, the two main reasons are:
   <ul> 1. Ferrari power-unit clampdown in 2020, following the FIA investigation, resulted in poor performance of all 3
    Ferrari-powered cars </ul>
    <ul> 2. the team decision to focus entirely on 2022 car, essentially abandoning 2021 season.</ul>

        <i>"We will only work in the wind tunnel for 2022. If everything doesn’t go wrong, we won’t do anything with the 2021 car but           focus entirely on the car for 2022."</i>

    This declared approach to 2021/2022 by Gunther is one of those things that sounds good and correct in theory, but is a bad
    approach in practice and usually a symptom of deeper issues. Later in the text we will explain why we believe the approach to 2021 wasn't chosen by Gunther, but one he was forced to take, following new deals made in late 2020 with - Ferrari.
    <h2>What went down in Italy during December 2020</h2>
    <span>December 2020 was the month of news in Haas F1
    </span><p></p>
    <h3><ul>News no1. - new driver lineup </ul></h3>
    The story of complete lineup change was long brewing and in December the rumors were confirmed - Haas chose to take two rookies from F2, Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin. Arrival of young Schumacher was expected, but there was one unknown. It was expected that Schumacher would end up in either Haas or Alfa Romeo, with the sentiment was slightly leaning towards Alfa Romeo. After all, that was the standard way of Ferrari hopes arriving to F1, this was the path of Ferrari's current start Leclerc path. This was not the case with Schumacher. If you're to believe the latest Drive To Survive
    (which I don't), this was the result of Gunther's shrewd negotiating skills.
    <p></p>
    <h3><ul>News no2. - new Haas hub in Maranello</ul></h3>
    The Schumacher&Mazepin photoshoots were getting the frontpages, but this was the real change in Haas. Haas was opening another team hub, this time in Italy. Specifically, in Maranello. Specifically inside Ferrari's facilities complex. Consisting of (former) Ferrari employes. One couldn't blame some news outlets reporting it as "Ferrari opening a new Haas hub".

    The blunt explanation of the cause of this move is - Ferrari was looking for a way to get around the incoming budget cap of $145 million.
    With Ferrari preparing for the challenge of trimming down both its personnel numbers and development costs in response to
    the arrival of a budget cap, it wanted to redeploy key staff to its customer team. The key figure here is Simone Resta, Ferrari's head of
    chassis engineering at the time, who was moved to become the new technical director of Haas F1 and the person running Haas' Maranello hub.
    <div class="pt-3 pb-3">
      <div>
        <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block"
             width="50%" src='https://www.formula1.com/content/dam/fom-website/manual/Misc/2020/2020races/Sakhir/100127tst.jpg.transform/9col/image.jpg'>
      </div>
    </div>

    Haas was lacking both money and personnel to produce a competitive car, but had no issues
    with the upcoming budget cap. Ferrari has plenty of both money and personnel, too many in fact, and upcoming budget cap presented a big problem for them, problem which they wanted to circumvent. It was a perfect match.
    Binotto of course immediately denied possibility of any kind of exchange of information between
    Ferrari and the new Haas hub. He explained that is not possible because, even though the new Haas employees will
    remain in the Ferrari HQ complex in Maranello, but they will be "in a completely different building".
    <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
      <div class="left-90">
        <i>"These people will work in Maranello in a completely different building to where Ferrari works. Some of our people will join their team" (...) "...because we have to downsize, I am very happy that our boys can go to Haas and not be available for another team."</i>
        <p>- Mattia Binotto</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-10">
        <img width="100" src='https://pm1.narvii.com/7686/7e8f8f842dfdce8941b2c70d029b8d6f8abed676r1-430-430v2_128.jpg'>
      </div>
    </div>
    When asked whether there was connection between arrival of Schumacher and arrival of Resta, Gunther denied there was
    any direct connection
    <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
      <div class="left-90">
        <i>"The connection to Mick is not direct. Obviously we work very close together with Ferrari, so when it was discussed
          we needed to reinforce our technical team after we went a little bit backwards the last year with the pandemic."
          “So, he (Resta) was a good choice – but it has nothing to do directly with Mick driving for us.”"</i>
        <p>- Gunther Steiner</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-10">
        <img width="100" src='https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_thumb,h_256,w_256,f_auto,g_faces,z_0.7,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/jhy5oxpwlwpgckyopg9o'>
      </div>
    </div>
    The result is that Haas now has its own (de jure, atleast) team for the car bodywork. As was said, Resta was Ferrari's
    head of chassis engineering. This puts a big question mark on the relationship of Haas with their
    chassis supplier thus far - Dallara. Gunther explained how it all synergises nicely though:
    <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
      <div class="left-90">
        <span style="padding-right: 0.08em">
        <i><ul>"We had our people last year... two years ago, sorry, not last year, as last year we stopped for quite a while, more
          people from Dallara and we replaced some of the people from Dallara with people from Ferrari."</ul>
          <ul>"It's not a satellite Ferrari team, we have got the Haas F1 structure but we still have an office at
          Dallara as well because we use about an average of 30 people from Dallara as well."</ul>

          <ul>"Nothing has changed in the principle, it's just that instead of having some people from Dallara before, we got some
          people from Ferrari for the future. Not a lot has changed it's just the exchange of where they are coming from."</ul>

          <ul>"They (Ferrari men) are concentrating on the '22 car."</ul>
          <ul>"As I said plenty of times before, we abandoned the '21 car. We did a little bit of work on reliability issues with
          the '21 car but they are now getting to the end."</ul>
          <ul>"So all the people in Maranello - because this is Haas people and Ferrari people - they are focusing '22, and
          Dallara they switched over to '22 and they do the odd job on the '21 car if it is needed but not performance, just
          for issues if we have one.""</ul>
        </i>
        <p>- Gunther Steiner</p>
          </span>
      </div>
      <div class="right-10">
        <img width="100" src='https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_thumb,h_256,w_256,f_auto,g_faces,z_0.7,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/jhy5oxpwlwpgckyopg9o'>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>That clears everything up.</p>
    Do you need Dallara if you now have your own (Ferrari) development team? Well... not really. You only need them for the support of the car that's still used in 2021, as Gunther is basically saying "if it is needed but not performance, just for issues if we have one".

    <p> Which brings us to Gunther's statement about deciding to
    bin the 2021 season. Knowning what we know - how can we say that decision was anything but forced by the change in development structure?
      Let us imagine he chose to work on the 2021 car. Was that feasible? No, it was not.
    - Dallara influence was downsized, remaining team is only there in the case of a detected defect. And they're sure to charge him those interventions.
    - Resta team (and again, Resta is the new technical director of Haas, so we can simply call it Haas team) does not work on the 2021 car because
    <ul> a) they can truthfully say they're not the ones who designed it to begin with and are not familiar with it </ul>
    <ul> b) Resta team is there to work on the 2022 car and beyond. And we intentionally say "the 2022 car" without the name
    of the team they're making it for. </ul>
    It is in the interest of Ferrari to split the car development across two teams, with as little overlap as possible. Working on a 2021 Haas serves no purpose whatsoever for the Ferrari boys, and as result - there was never going to be a 2021 Haas car and Steiner knew it.
<p></p>
    <h2>Rookie lineup and the new Russian element</h2>
    We've mentioned the arrival of Schumacher, but not of Mazepin. Where arrival of Schumacher was likely result of Haas
    and Ferrari becoming closer connected through the new Maranello hub, Mazepin came as a part of the Uralkali
    sponsorship. His arrival got a substantial amount of bad press coverage, but, except for the sponsorship money, do we think Mazepin arrival has a big effect the future of Haas?
    <p>No, we don't</p>
    <ul>Do we think departure of Uralkali and Mazepin would put the future of Haas in danger</ul>
    <p>No, we don't</p>
    This may seem like we're downplaying Haas' financial and sponsorhip struggles (anyone for a Rich Energy drink?). But, even though Gunther often give the impression of a team on the verge of falling apart and going under, December 2020 changes gave yet another failsafe to Haas. There's Haas money from US, then there's Uralkali money from Russia, and now there's Ferrari power in Italy. Even though this cannot be publicly stated by any of the parties, Ferrari is now even more
    invested in Haas remaining in F1 as their customer (or junior, depending who you ask) team, and are personally invested in the future of Haas in F1.
  <p></p>
    <h3><ul>Schumacher - Mazepin rivalry</ul></h3>
    Considering the state of 2021 car, this one was unexpected. In their rookies seasons, driving a car that the team itself has given up on before the season even began - rookie drivers are agressively fighting over... are agressively fighting. One would expect them to be frustrated with the car, not each other. And yet the number of on-track contacts and post-race negative interviews keeps going up.
    The rivalry is imbalanced so far - on one side Schumacher, the rookie public is rooting to win because of his lineage,
    and probably will win out because he was the F2 champion and has shown better performance in 2021. On the other side Mazepin, the rookie public is rooting
    against because of his history of poor behaviour, and he probably will lose because he finished 5th in F2 and wouldn't be in that seat without the sponsorship he brings.
    <p></p>
    <h1>The future</h1>
    The performance of Haas 2022 car will be strongly related to the performance of Ferrari 2022 car. What the Maranello
    crew is aware of is that the Haas car is not allowed to be at the same time both good and too similar to Ferrari car.
    This caused complaints in 2018, which will only be louder with the new changes to the Haas development structure. If the car is truly designed by the CFD department in Kannapolis, and not Resta's team in Maranello, this issue shouldn't arise.

In their rookies seasons, driving a car that the team itself has given up on before the start of the seaon - rookie drivers are agressively fighting over... are agressively fighting. The number of on-track contacts and post-race negative interviews keeps going up. Luckily for Haas PR, the car is so slow that most of the public doesn't really notice it, but if this continues, Guenther's doors are in danger of some further foksmashing down the line.
  The rivalry is imbalanced - on one side Schumacher, the rookie public is rooting to win because of his lineage,
  and probably will win out because he was the F2 champion and has shown better performance in 2021. On the other side Mazepin, the rookie public is rooting
