    <h2>Story of Haas</h2>
    Haas F1 team was founded by Gene
    Haas, man who already had a strong presence in US motorsport, such as NASCAR, and wished to expand his brand recognition
    worldwide. As he explained it:
    <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
      <div class="left-90">
        <i>"Just like NASCAR is very dominant in the United States - half of our production is actually consumed in the
          United States. If we could increase our market share by even 1 or 2 percent in the rest of the world that would
          almost double our sales. That really is the goal to bring that brand recognition, produce more product in the
          United States and sell more overseas."</i>
        <p>- Gene Haas</p>

    <p>After conversations with former Jaguar and Red Bull Racing technical director Guenther Steiner, Haas F1 team - the new hope of American F1 fans - was born. Haas already had their racing HQ and it only made sense to have their F1 headquarters building next to the headquarters of the sister NASCAR team Stewart-Haas Racing, in the town of Kannapolis</p>

    Kannapolis is the location of Haas headquarters. There is a belief that this HQ isn't meaningfully involved in the making of
    the car. According to Haas team this is incorrect  - the theoretical design of the car originates in Kannapolis, crucially this is
    where their Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) department is located (which will become relevant later).

    <p>In simple terms, CFD uses computer simulations to solve aerodynamics problems. There's a cute saying: "In theory, there is no
      difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is." Well, in theory there is no difference between a CFD
      simulation and a wind tunnel testing.
      For further details, we recommend an article from 2018, aptly named
      <a href="https://racer.com/2018/03/09/insight-what-does-haas-u-s-base-actually-do/" target="_blank"> "What does Haas' U.S. base actually do?"
      </a> where people like Ben Agathangelou, Haas chief aerodynamicist and Charles Jenckes, Haas F1 CFD aerodynamicist and team leader, give answers to this question.
    </p>
    So it is Kannapolis that creates the car designs, runs computer simulations, and passes the designs and CFD results. Let's move on.

      Banbury is the team's European HQ and their raceteam logistics centre, after the facility was bought from the former
      F1 team Marussia. In 2016 when the team was starting, Guenther made short but informative tour through the facility,
      explaining what it is responsible for. </p>

    It is Banbury that the Haas paddock considers their home and from where the car and equipment are sent across the world. But where is the car actually made?

      FIA rules split car components in two categories:
    <ul> - 'listed parts' - every constructor has to design themselves (or own the IP to). This includes, crucially, all
      bodywork "in contact with the external airstream," i.e. all aerodynamic surfaces of the car.</ul>
    <ul> - 'non-listed parts' - parts that team can buy from other teams ranging from engines, gearboxes, the suspension system to various mechanical parts.</ul>

    <p>Haas always buys whatever the rules allow them to buy from - Ferrari, located in Maranello</p>
    What about the aerodynamic surfaces - the chassis of the car, which cannot be bought from other team? Every season <u>so far</u> the chassis was made by <a href="https://www.dallara.it/en" target="_blank">Dallara</a>, Italian racecar constructor and manufacturer from Varano de' Melegari near Parma, about an hour drive from Maranello. The aerodynamic development and testing of that chassis is done in a wind tunnel. Whose tunnel? You're probably guessing the answer - Ferrari's.

    <h2>... but actually Maranello, Italy</h2>
    <span>In December 2020 Haas announced the news that the team was opening another hub, this time in Italy. Specifically, in Maranello, inside Ferrari's facilities complex, consisting of (former) Ferrari employees. The details of this news we're
describing in post <a href="/#/posts/post?code=Are-Haas-and-Ferrari-too-close-8d476">"Are Haas and Ferrari too close?"</a>
      .
      As we explained, in the past the non-listed parts were made by Ferrari, while the listed parts were made by Dallara . Starting with the 2022 Haas car (we are skipping the 2021 car since Haas skipped it too), the non-listed parts will continue to be made by Ferrari, while the listed parts - will be made by (former) Ferrari. This does not breach FIA regulations regarding listed parts because

    <h2>...and back to Kannapolis, North Carolina</h2>
    <p>So like in any company - who is pulling most of the weight? Who is dispensable?</p>
    <p><b>Italian hub verdict:</b> <span class="text-success">indispensable</span>, since they are the ones who build the actual car, and there is no doubt that Haas could not enter the sport (or remain in it) without the Ferrari support, both in equipment and personnel.</p>
    <p><b>English hub verdict:</b> <span class="text-success">indispensable</span>, since that's where the pitlane crew resides and all the oh-so-complex logistics required for a team to run and attend races across the globe.</p>
    <p><b>US hub verdict: </b><span class="text-danger">dispensable</span>. We mentioned earlier the belief by some that Kannapolis isn't actively involved in the building of the car and racing. Is this theory plausible? Is it theoretically possible to use Kannapolis building as a nice poster building for Haas name, while having all the carmaking done exclusively by Italian hub, and all race logistics by Banbury facility? Yes, is is possible. </p>
    <p>Do I believe this theory is true? Though I want to answer no, I have to say - it could be true.
      Already worrying situation is made worse by the changes done in December 2020, which threaten to diminish the contribution of Kannapolis HQ because Maranello crew is definitely more than capable to take over their tasks in the future if they haven't already done so - and without breaking any FIA regualations since the Maranello hub crew are now Haas employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then we look at <a href="https://www.haasf1team.com/careers" target="_blank">current job listings at Haas
    </a>. They're all located in Maranello, Modena. And one stands out:

      <span class="text-center"><i>Haas Team job listings</i></span>
    </div>
    As we can see Haas currently (September 27th, 2021) requires a CFD Team Leader - but in Maranello, not Kannapolis.
    <p>
      I do also recommend an  <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2021/09/08/q-kannapolis-based-haas-f1-team-technical-director-simone-resta-hopes-new-car-2022/" target="_blank">interesting interview with Simone Resta,
    </a>
      team's new technical director, who runs the Maranello hub. He lists all crucial members of the team and how they work together.

    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Haas was formed as an interesting amalgamation of pieces. Can this 3-hub model be stable? Yes. Is it a model for success?
    It can be, modern organizations are moving away from the single monolithic structure. The problem is that the newest hub - Maranello hub, has two masters and is cementing the position of Haas as the outpost of Ferrari team, while the official HQ in Kannapolis isn't active enough to offset this.
