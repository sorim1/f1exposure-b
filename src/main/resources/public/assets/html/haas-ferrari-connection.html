  <p>Yup, that's me, Guenther. I bet you're wondering how I got myself into this situation. Well, it all started two months earlier...</p>
  <div class="pt-3 pb-3">
    <h1>Two months earlier</h1>
    <p>It was December, 2020. In a relatively short span, Haas announced two news regarding the future of the team
    </p>
    <h2><ul>News 1 - Mick & Nick</ul></h2>
    <div class="left-div-70">
      The rumors were confirmed - Haas announced an all-new driver lineup consisting of two rookies from F2, Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin. Regarding Mick, it was expected he would join F1 in 2021 in either Haas or Alfa Romeo, with the expectations slightly leaning towards Alfa Romeo. That was the standard way of Ferrari drivers arriving to F1, for example the current Ferrari star driver Leclerc arrived that way. But instead of Alfa Romeo, Schumacher ended in Haas. If you're to believe the latest Drive To Survive
      , this was the result of Gunther's shrewd negotiating skills.

    <h2><ul>News 2 - New Haas hub in Maranello</ul></h2>
    <p>
      While Schumacher&Mazepin photoshoots were getting the frontpages, this was the real change in Haas. Haas announced that they were opening another team hub, this time in Italy, in a little town called  - Maranello. Yes, the new hub was to be inside Ferrari complex and the new team was consisting of (officially former) Ferrari employes. One couldn't blame some news outlets reporting it as <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ferrari-to-set-up-haas-hub-f1-facility-at-maranello-base-4976155/4976155/" target="_blank">"Ferrari opening a Haas hub"</a>.</p>
    <p>What was happening here?</p>
    <p>This was the result of incoming FIA regulations regarding team budget cap of $145 million.
      With Ferrari preparing for the challenge of trimming down both its personnel numbers and development costs in response to
      the arrival of a budget cap, it wanted to redeploy key staff to its customer team.

      <span class="text-center"><i>Haas and Ferrari team principals</i></span>
    </div>
    <p>Haas needed money and personnel to produce a competitive car. </p><p>Ferrari had plenty of both money and personnel, too much actually, and needed a way to circumvent the budget cap. </p><p>It was a perfect match.</p>

    <h2>Simone Resta</h2>
    The leader of Ferrari-turned-Haas personnel is Simone Resta. Before December he was head of
    chassis engineering in Ferrari. Following December he's the new technical director of Haas F1, and the person that, according to Guenther Steiner, is running Haas' Maranello hub.
    <div class="pt-3 pb-3 text-center">

      <span><i>Simone Resta, new technical director of Haas</i></span>
    </div>

    <p>Maranello team run by Resta is to build the new Haas 2022 car, and have been working on this task exclusively, since February. In the past, Haas was buying nonlisted parts from Ferrari, while the listed parts were built primarily by Dallara. With this change, the chassic will be built by the new Haas hub located inside Ferrari facility. Obvious worry is - is this development team a Haas team or a second Ferrari team? </p>
    Binotto of course immediately denied possibility of any kind of exchange of information between
    Ferrari and Haas hub. He explained that is not the case because, even though the new Haas employees will
    remain in the Ferrari complex in Maranello, they will be "in a completely different building".
    <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
      <div class="left-90">
        <i>"These people will work in Maranello in a completely different building to where Ferrari works. Some of our people will join their team" (...) "...because we have to downsize, I am very happy that our boys can go to Haas and not be available for another team."</i>
        <p>- Mattia Binotto</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-10">

      </div>
    </div>
    Meanwhile Gunther was asked whether there was connection between arrival of Schumacher and arrival of Resta, and he denied any direct connection
    <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
      <div class="left-90">
        <i>"The connection to Mick is not direct. Obviously we work very close together with Ferrari, so when it was discussed
          we needed to reinforce our technical team after we went a little bit backwards the last year with the pandemic."
          “So, he (Resta) was a good choice – but it has nothing to do directly with Mick driving for us.”"</i>
        <p>- Gunther Steiner</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-10">
        <img width="100" src='https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_thumb,h_256,w_256,f_auto,g_faces,z_0.7,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/jhy5oxpwlwpgckyopg9o'>

    </div>
    If we are to look at this from a positive side - Haas now has its very own team for the car bodywork. This does put a big question mark on the relationship with their chassis supplier thus far - Dallara. Gunther explained that there was some downsizing regarding Dallara, but it all synergises nicely:
    <div class="d-flex bg-light div-margin-1rem div-padded-1rem">
      <div class="left-90">
        <span style="padding-right: 0.08em">
        <i><ul>"We had our people last year... two years ago, sorry, not last year, as last year we stopped for quite a while, more
          people from Dallara and we replaced some of the people from Dallara with people from Ferrari."</ul>
          <ul>"It's not a satellite Ferrari team, we have got the Haas F1 structure but we still have an office at
          Dallara as well because we use about an average of 30 people from Dallara as well."</ul>

          <ul>"Nothing has changed in the principle, it's just that instead of having some people from Dallara before, we got some
          people from Ferrari for the future. Not a lot has changed it's just the exchange of where they are coming from."</ul>

          <ul>"They (Ferrari men) are concentrating on the '22 car."</ul>
          <ul>"As I said plenty of times before, we abandoned the '21 car. We did a little bit of work on reliability issues with
          the '21 car but they are now getting to the end."</ul>
          <ul>"So all the people in Maranello - because this is Haas people and Ferrari people - they are focusing '22, and
          Dallara they switched over to '22 and they do the odd job on the '21 car if it is needed but not performance, just
          for issues if we have one.""</ul>

      <div class="right-10">
        <img width="100" src='https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_thumb,h_256,w_256,f_auto,g_faces,z_0.7,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/jhy5oxpwlwpgckyopg9o'>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>That clears everything up.</p>
    <p>
      Does Guenther need Dallara if he now has his own (Ferrari) development team? Yes, but only during 2021. Gunther needs them for the support of the car that's still used in 2021, and he wants to minimize that need, as he explained it <i>"if it is needed but not performance, just for issues if we have one" </i>.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is Resta's boss?</h2>
    <p> Which brings us to Guenther's repeated statement about deciding to not work on the 2021 car except minimal changes to fit the regulations. Knowning what we know - was not that decision forced by the change in development structure?
      Let us imagine Guenther chose to work on the 2021 car. Was that feasible? No, it was not.
    <ul> - Dallara influence was downsized, remaining team is only there in a passive support role, not active 2021 car development</ul>
    <ul>  - the team of Haas' new technical director Resta does not work on the 2021 car because
      <ul> a) they can truthfully say they're not the ones who designed it to begin with and are not familiar with it </ul>
      <ul> b) Resta's hub is there to work on the 2022 car and beyond. And we intentionally say "the 2022 car" without the name
        of the team they're making it for. </ul></ul>
    <p>
      It is in the interest of Ferrari to split the car development across two teams, with as little overlap as possible. Working on a 2021 Haas serves no purpose whatsoever for the Ferrari boys, and as result - there was never going to be a 2021 Haas car and Steiner had to accept it.
    </p>
    <h2>This is bad, right?</h2>
    <p>
      Depends on your point of view. The idea of a small Haas team making it on its own is dead.
      The performance of Haas 2022 car will be strongly related to the performance of Ferrari 2022 car. Is there really a barrier between Haas and Ferrari in Maranello - this depends completely on the good will of Resta and Binotto. They do not want to provoke complaints from other teams that would force FIA to investigate the matter deeper. Such close relationship cannot afford the heat that Racing Point had in 2020 with the "pink mercedes" accusations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I choose to <span
      style="text-decoration: line-through;"> act dumb and </span> believe this is good news. Haas now has their own development team, offshoot of the very Ferrari team. Haas also has Schumacher, result of Haas and Ferrari becoming closer than ever.</p>
    <p>Who says the little teams can't make it in F1.</p>
